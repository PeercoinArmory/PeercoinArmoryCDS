SHORTDESCR: Wallet Consistency Issues in 0.90 and Earlier
LONGDESCR:
   It is highly recommended that all systems that distribute payment addresses
   be upgraded to Armory 0.91 or later.  These versions of Armory check
   wallet consistency on startup, and add general robustness against certain
   kinds of hardware errors and wallet-manipulation attacks.

   These checks should be performed on online hot wallets and online
   watching-only wallets.  It is not necessary to upgrade any offline computers
   just to check wallet consistency.  All issues related to this notification
   can be identified and/or avoided by simply upgrading the system that
   creates transactions and distributes payment addresses.
